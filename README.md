# Webpack3_Prac
A practice app for developing my own webpack to understand it better


Please note that there are left over tech inside the package.json and webpack.config.js files because of the different types of webpack setups that wore setup throughout the git i.e. both files don't show the minimal required setup for the final webpack.

If you are reviewing my work on this repo it is best done by looking at each commit of data as it will show the different ways webpack can be used to setup development projects.
